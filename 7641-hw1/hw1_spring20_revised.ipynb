    "Due to recent customer unsatisfaction, Amazon is reevaluating their prime 2-day shipping policy to determine whether their shipping guarantee should be 1-day, 3-day, or remain 2-day. In order to do this, Amazon is using a new package verification system to analyze the punctuality of its shipped packages from different distances. The new system classifies travel distance as less than 1000 miles, less than 2000 miles, and less than 3000 miles and classifies arrival time as 1 day, 2 days, 3 days. From their records, 10% of packages arrive in 1 day and 65% of packages arrive in 2 days. Packages travel less than 2000 miles 85% of the time and less than 1000 miles 50% of the time. Also, the probability that a package arrives in a day if it travelled greater than 2000 miles is 0. The probability of a package arriving in 1 day and travelling less than 1000 miles is equal to the probability of a package travelling from 1000 miles up to 2000 miles and arriving in 1 day. Assume no packages take more than 3 days to arrive or travel more than 3000 miles.\n",
